# Topic Modeling on Texts using Latent Semantic Analysis 

We will use Document-Term Matrix, TF-IDF, SVD and K-means to discover a set of topics discussed in a dataset of tweets posted by Russian accounts during the 2016 election season. We will apply TruncatedSVD to reduce the dimensonality of our data before applying K-Means clustering to group documents into clusters(topics).
